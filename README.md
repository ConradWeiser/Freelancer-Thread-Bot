# Freelancer Thread Reporter

## Introduction

A discord bot written on top of the [JDA Library](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/) designed to keep watch over certain sections of the [DiscoveryGC forums](http://www.discoverygc.com/forums), and report to each registered user when a thread matching a set of keywords given by the user is found.

Currently, the bot only watches the [Communications Channel](https://discoverygc.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=59) however more will be supported as time goes on

A proper readme to come...
